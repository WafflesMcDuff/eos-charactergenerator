# eos-charactergenerator
Character generator, editor and sheet for the Dutch science-fiction larp [Eos Frontier](http://www.eosfrontier.space).

_This project has started on 17-Jan-2018, with the purpose of creating a digital, easy-to-read, easy-to-fill-in character sheet._

## backend info ##
The character generator will be using **PHP**, to easily work with the Joomla-based website and reinforce the goal of having one login for everything Eos related. Due to the nature of PHP, the database will be MySQLi.
